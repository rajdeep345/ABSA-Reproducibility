It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the $T$ more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .

When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the $T$ must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .

Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a $T$ with what seems like barely enough room -LRB- no matter what the size of your party -RRB- , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .

Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the $T$ at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .

The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible $T$ .

Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however $T$ or other sauce would have done much to enhance .

I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the $T$ , the experiance .
