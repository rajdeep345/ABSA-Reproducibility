I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an $T$ -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

While the $ 20 $T$ is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .

Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been $T$ -LRB- and that order was undercooked -RRB- , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .

On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and $T$ that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .

I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the $T$ was rude an unattentive .
service
-1
Overall , the ingredients and $T$ are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .
technique
1
I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

not the food , not the $T$ , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .

take-out pizza

- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a $T$ .
